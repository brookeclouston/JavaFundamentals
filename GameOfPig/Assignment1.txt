The purpose of this assignment is to give you practice designing and coding methods, and using loops, conditionals and console I/O.

The Game of Pig has been around for quite a while, requiring just one or two dice to play. You can read over the Wikipedia entry for more information. This assignment will use a two-dice variation where sixes are "bad". You will write a program that will allow you (the "player") to play against the computer. The rules of the game are:

The first player to accumulate a score of 100 or more wins.
The human goes first.
After one roll, a player has the choice to "hold" or to roll again. They can roll as many times as they like unless they get one or two sixes.
You roll two dice. Certain conditions apply:
If both dice are sixes the player's total score is set to zero and his turn is over. Ouch!
If one dice is six, then your turn is over and your turn score is set to zero.
If both dice match ("doubles"), other than sixes, then you gain twice the sum of the dice, and you must roll again. For example if you rolled two fours, you would gain 16 and then have to roll again.
For any other dice combination, you just add the dice total to your turn score and you have the choice of rolling again.
When your turn is over, either because you won, you chose not to roll again or you rolled a six, then your turn sum is added to your accumulated score.
